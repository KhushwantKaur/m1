            <p>Choir director Beat Lehmann was born in Switzerland where he first became involved in choir music by participating
                in classical productions like Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Mass in C minor etc. A study year abroad gave him
                the opportunity to sing with the Pontardullais Welsh Male Choir. After completing an M.A. in Social Anthropology
                he concentrated on his other passion, dance, directing a Modern Dance Company for several years. In 1986,
                Beat migrated to Australia where he completed a Ph.D. in Linguistics and involved himself in choir music
                again. For 12 years he conducted AkaBella, a well-known world music choir from Bellingen, NSW. AkaBella participated
                in major festivals like the National Folk Festival in Canberra, the Bellingen Global Carnival and theWoodford
                Folk Festival where they featured in the ABC documentary ÃƒÂ¬Festival on Fire and launched their first CD
                'Mosaic'. Beat moved to Magnetic Island in 2003 and has established a similarly successful world music choir
                for the Townsville area. Beat's choirs focus on the rich musical heritage of cultures around the globe. A
                South African party song, a Hungarian love triangle, a Mexican lullaby, a French version of 'The Lion Sleeps
                Tonight' to delve into the incredible variety and depth of a cappella world music and the cultures it represents,
                is not only fun, but a very enriching and uplifting experience.
